                        Hello my love, happy quatre mois.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You are the greatest thing to have happened to me. I honestly cannot describe how much you mean to me. These past 4 months have meant so much to me, these past 7 have been so <em>magical</em>. Every day we live a different experience, every day i am surprised by you, every day i need you and want you more, every day i love you more than the last. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You are my most things, you have so many things to offer and you're so incredibly deserving. To say otherwise is simply incorrect. I cannot stress this enough when I say I want to spend forever with you. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our 4 months, let's think about this a little...
                        <br>
                        I'm born on the 4th of july &#8680; fast foward 18 years on the 18th of december &#8680; i meet you, you're smart and beautiful and funny, we fall in love. In April we celebrated our 2 months &#8680; Two months later here we are. (4=2+2 and we're two people and um we'll have 2 kids! &#128578;, idk i'm not as good at all this as you) 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I don't know what to say bubbaby, I think you know it all. So, let this serve as a reminder. You are an immaculate love-er (not lover because we haven't done the hokey pokey yet) with so much heart and meaning, in everything you do. You are so beautifful, I can't wait to trace my fingers along you, along your body lool, your face, your strong sharp jawline and rosy lips, your cute nose (before and after). I could stare into your eyes for hours, i see so much in them, so much depth and meaning, so many hardships, so much strength and bravery. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We've been through so much together, especially this past fortnight which has been exceptionally difficult for the two of us. But through all the rough (&#128527;) times, we have found our way, and we will continue to find our way. You are my most things mariana, and I will do anything for you, for us. I love you so fucking much, i look forward to talking to you, to seeing your gorgeous face, to hear your graceful voice. God i want so much with you. You are my most things bubba. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I fucking love you so fucking much Mariana Haroune.
